Character
    Name
    Description (Just a large text with detailed character information)
    Role (Valid roles — leading, supporting, background)
NOTES:
    ** A character can be played by a person (or actor) (Other Table)
    ** Might be played by unknown actors for whom we don’t have profiles
    ** It’s also important to account for situations where an actor appears 
    in a movie as part of a crowd or as a background character. In such cases, 
    it may not be possible to create a separate character for these roles, 
    but it would be nice to have a way to record the actor’s participation in the movie. 
    Try to consider these points during the database design.
